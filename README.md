# Uber_rides_project
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber rides data using Python. The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize key insights about ride patterns.

# Steps Involved:
Loading Data: Opened the Uber rides dataset in Python using Pandas after reading it from an Excel file.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted datetime columns for better analysis.

Data Analysis: Explored Perpose of the Ride, trip timming, trip catagory(buisness or personal).

Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful charts such as  bar graphs.

Saving Visualizations: Exported the generated plots as images for reporting and further use.

This project showcases my ability to work with real-world data, clean it, and generate meaningful insights through visualization. It also demonstrates my proficiency in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
